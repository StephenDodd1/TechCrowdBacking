Initially, the user is given some suggestions. These are great for
those that really don't know what they are looking for. Headline news
pertaining to technology is there, and some tech stocks are listed,
and threads from HackerNews, a forum for discussing all things tech,
displays latest threads relating to tech stocks.

The goal of this site is to enable investors to make informed
investments, and help them to identify tech stocks specifically. As
the name implies, the secondary purpose of the site is to promote 
technology and and the companies that produce it.

The purpose of the app is to help investors make sound investments in
companies and technologies they believe in, and would like to support,
as one of the biggest problems that tech companies often face early on
is a cashflow problem. It can take years to develop a new technology
that yields positive cashflows.

TechCrowdBacking helps investors to support companies that may have
great ideas that require a large time and capital commitment. 
Investors play a crucial, and sometimes lucrative role in supporting
these companies and the technologies they are bringing to fruition by
providing the capital to see these technologies to maturity.
